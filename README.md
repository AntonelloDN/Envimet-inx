## Limits:
- Project library is not supported (use user library instead for now or free-form)

- [ ] A better idea for textures
- [ ] Material info improvement
- [ ] Point concept to create plant3D and receptors
- [x] Recursive method to change object layer - available here but to be publish on Sketchup Extension Warehouse
- [ ] Working to a new version without layers. WIP
